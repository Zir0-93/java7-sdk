/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events.
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 * convenience for creating listener objects.
 * <P>
 * Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked,
 * moved, dragged, when it enters a component, when it exits and
 * when a mouse wheel is moved.
 * <P>
 * Extend this class to create a {@code MouseEvent}
 * (including drag and motion events) or/and {@code MouseWheelEvent}
 * listener and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * {@code MouseListener},
 * {@code MouseMotionListener}
 * interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 * all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * <P>
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 * a component using the component's {@code addMouseListener}
 * {@code addMouseMotionListener}, {@code addMouseWheelListener}
 * methods.
 * The relevant method in the listener object is invoked  and the {@code MouseEvent}
 * or {@code MouseWheelEvent}  is passed to it in following cases:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>when a mouse button is pressed, released, or clicked (pressed and  released)
 * <li>when the mouse cursor enters or exits the component
 * <li>when the mouse wheel rotated, or mouse moved or dragged
 * </ul>
