/**
 * This exception is thrown by

 * AccessControlContext context)</code> to indicate
 * that the action being performed threw a checked exception.  The exception
 * thrown by the action can be obtained by calling the
 * <code>getException</code> method.  In effect, an
 * <code>PrivilegedActionException</code> is a "wrapper"
 * for an exception thrown by a privileged action.
 *
 * <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
 * the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "exception thrown
 * by the privileged computation" that is provided at construction time and
 * accessed via the {@link #getException()} method is now known as the
 * <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()}
 * method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
