/**
 * The PreDestroy annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to
 * signal that the instance is in the process of being removed by the
 * container. The method annotated with PreDestroy is typically used to
 * release resources that it has been holding. This annotation MUST be
 * supported by all container managed objects that support PostConstruct
 * except the application client container in Java EE 5. The method on which
 * the PreDestroy annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following
 * criteria -
 * - The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of EJB
 * interceptors in which case it takes an InvocationContext object as defined
 * by the EJB specification.
 * - The return type of the method MUST be void.
 * - The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.
 * - The method on which PreDestroy is applied MAY be public, protected,
 * package private or private.
 * - The method MUST NOT be static.
 * - The method MAY be final.
 * - If the method throws an unchecked exception it is ignored except in the
 * case of EJBs where the EJB can handle exceptions.
